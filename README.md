# Intelligent Student Query Advisor and FAQ Enhancer

## 1. Project Introduction

### Title

Intelligent Student Query Advisor and FAQ Enhancer

### Overview

This project is designed to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that efficiently processes student queries, categorizes them, predicts key service metrics, and uncovers hidden patterns in the data. By integrating both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques along with a robust database, the project aims to improve query resolution, enhance support services, and provide valuable insights for decision-makers.

### Objectives

- **Automate Query Routing:** Categorize incoming student queries into appropriate topics.
- **Predict Service Metrics:** Estimate response times and satisfaction scores.
- **Discover Hidden Trends:** Use clustering to identify emerging topics and group similar queries.
- **Ensure Transparency:** Implement model explainability to provide insights into decision-making.

## 2. Data Ingestion & Storage

### Dataset Overview

- Description of the dataset: contains student query records, including timestamps, categories, satisfaction ratings, response times, and resolution status.
- Explanation of the data source (e.g., CSV files) and what each key column represents.

### Database Integration (Add in future changes)

- Overview of how data will be imported into a relational database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL).
- Discussion about using an ORM or database connectivity tool to manage data persistence.
- Outline the purpose of establishing a central data repository for continuous updates and real-time analysis.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Describe procedures for handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
- Explain any feature engineering steps (e.g., converting timestamps to date-time objects or creating new derived metrics).

### Data Visualization

- **Histograms:** To examine distribution of numerical variables such as satisfaction scores.
- **Bar Charts:** For displaying the frequency of queries across different categories.
- **Box/Violin Plots:** To identify variability and outliers in response times among categories.
- **Scatter Plots:** To explore relationships between variables such as response time and satisfaction.
- **Time Series Plots:** To monitor trends in query volumes and average metrics over time.

## 4. Machine Learning Models

### Supervised Learning

- **Classification:**  
  Describe the goal to classify student queries (for example, categorizing them by type such as academic, financial, technical).  
  Mention the potential use of binary or multi-class classification methods.
- **Regression:**  
  Outline the objective to predict numerical outcomes such as response time or satisfaction scores.  
  Explain the importance of regression methods in quantifying service performance.

### Unsupervised Learning

- **Clustering:**  
  Explain how clustering is used to group similar queries to uncover latent topics or identify patterns.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  Briefly mention methods like PCA or t-SNE to help visualize high-dimensional data for deeper insights.

## 5. Model Explainability

### Rationale for Interpretability

- Explain the need for transparency and interpretability in the model’s predictions.
- Mention the importance of using tools that can provide a clear breakdown of how each feature affects the model's output.

### Tools and Concepts

- **SHAP:**  
  Describe how it visually outlines the contribution of each feature.
- **LIME:**  
  Discuss how it provides local explanations, making it easier to understand individual predictions.

## 6. Deployment & Dashboard

### Deployment Strategy

- Outline the plan for integrating the trained models into a production environment.
- Discuss data flow from the database to the deployed models, and how predictions are updated in real time.

### Dashboard Overview

- Explain the concept of using an interactive dashboard to display key performance metrics.
- List the types of visualizations (graphs, tables, charts) that will be integrated into the dashboard.
- Mention usability aspects – real-time updates, interactivity, and ease of navigation for stakeholders.
