# Intelligent Student Query Advisor and FAQ Enhancer

## 1. Project Introduction

### Title

Intelligent Student Query Advisor and FAQ Enhancer

### Overview

This project is designed to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that efficiently processes student queries, categorizes them, predicts key service metrics, and uncovers hidden patterns in the data. By integrating both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques along with a robust database, the project aims to improve query resolution, enhance support services, and provide valuable insights for decision-makers.

### Objectives

- **Automate Query Routing:** Categorize incoming student queries into appropriate topics.
- **Predict Service Metrics:** Estimate response times and satisfaction scores.
- **Discover Hidden Trends:** Use clustering to identify emerging topics and group similar queries.
- **Ensure Transparency:** Implement model explainability to provide insights into decision-making.

### ðŸ’­Note:

- Feel free to give your feedback on the future improvements and what features you would like to see added in the future. Please share your thoughts and suggestions!

## 7. Conclusion & Future Improvements

### Summary

- Recap the primary achievements: automating query processing, predicting service metrics, and discovering hidden patterns.

### Conclusion

- The interactive query prediction system successfully classifies student queries and estimates response times using machine learning models.
- The classification model demonstrates moderate accuracy in assigning queries to predefined categories, while the regression model's performance indicates limitations in reliably predicting response times.
- Visualizations such as feature importance analysis and response distribution graphs provide deeper insights into model behavior.
- However, errors like low RÂ² scores and weak correlation in response time predictions highlight the need for further optimization.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore advanced approaches in NLP, such as deep learning models (LSTMs, transformers), to improve text-based query classification.
- Implement real-time learning methods to continuously fine-tune model performance based on streaming data.
- **Integrate a dynamic dashboard:** Develop an interactive dashboard using web frameworks like **Django** and **Flask** to provide real-time monitoring, visualization of model performance, and an accessible interface for end-users.
- Expand the dataset with more comprehensive real-world data to enhance model robustness and generalizability.
