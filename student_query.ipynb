    "This project is designed to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that efficiently processes student queries, categorizes them, predicts key service metrics, and uncovers hidden patterns in the data. By integrating both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques along with a robust database, the project aims to improve query resolution, enhance support services, and provide valuable insights for decision-makers"

    "Educational institutions often receive a high volume of student queries covering diverse topics such as academics, finances, and technical issues. Managing and responding to these queries efficiently is crucial for enhancing student satisfaction and administrative productivity. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify, predict, and analyze student queries while uncovering trends and improving decision-making processesâ€”all within a structured Jupyter Notebook environment."

The administration wants to implement an automated system that processes student queries submitted via an online portal. Your organization has collected historical data comprising student questions, query categories, response times, satisfaction ratings, and resolution feedback. The aim is to design an end-to-end pipeline that will not only predict relevant answers based on past interactions but also analyze emerging trends from new queries.\n",
