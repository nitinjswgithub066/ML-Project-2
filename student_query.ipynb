    "\n",
    "The \"optimal cluster\" refers to the best number of groups (clusters) to divide your data into when using clustering algorithms like K-Means. Choosing the right number of clusters helps you find meaningful patterns without overcomplicating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is it important?**  \n",
    "    Too few clusters may mix different types of data together, while too many clusters can split similar data unnecessarily.\n",
    "- **How do we find it?**  \n",
    "    The \"elbow method\" is a common technique: plot the number of clusters against a measure called WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares). The point where the decrease in WCSS slows down (forms an \"elbow\" shape) is usually the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**  \n",
